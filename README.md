# 📊 InstaFollowerInsight

A Python-based Instagram analytics tool that tracks and analyzes changes in followers and following lists over time.

## 🚀 Overview

**InstaFollowerInsight** is a full-stack automation tool that monitors Instagram accounts by taking snapshots of their followers and following lists. It uses web scraping and data comparison techniques to detect changes between different time intervals.

By comparing snapshots, the system identifies:

* ✅ New followers
* ❌ Unfollowers
* ➕ Newly followed accounts
* ➖ Unfollowed accounts

All processes are automated and accessible through a web interface.
